What’s Working?

1. Homepage:
   - Displays a list of job listings fetched from a mock API.
   - Each job listing is displayed in a card format with details like title, company, and location.
   - Clicking on a job card navigates to the job details page.

2. Job Details Page:
   - Displays detailed information about a specific job.
   - Fetches job data dynamically based on the job ID.

3. Company Dashboard:
   - Allows companies to post new job listings using a form.
   - Form validation is implemented using **React Hook Form**.

4. Dark Mode:
   - Toggle between light and dark mode using a button.
   - Dark mode is implemented using Tailwind CSS's `dark:` prefix.

5. State Management:
   - Zustand is used to manage the state of job listings.

6. Responsive Design:
   - The UI is fully responsive and works seamlessly on different screen sizes.

7. Mock API:
   - A mock API is implemented using Next.js API routes to simulate fetching and posting job data.


What’s Missing?

1. Authentication:
   - No authentication system is implemented. Companies and candidates cannot log in or sign up.
   - **NextAuth.js** or a similar library could be added for authentication.

2. Real Backend Integration:
   - The platform currently uses a mock API. A real backend (e.g., Node.js, Firebase, or a REST API) is needed for production.

3. Job Application Feature:
   - Candidates cannot apply for jobs. A form or workflow for applying to jobs is missing.

4. Pagination and Filtering:
   - The job listings page does not support pagination or filtering (e.g., by location, job type, etc.).

5. User Roles:
   - No distinction between company and candidate roles. Companies should have a dedicated dashboard, and candidates should have a profile.

6. Error Handling:
   - Proper error handling is not implemented for API requests or form submissions.

7. Deployment:
   - The app is not deployed. It can be deployed using **Vercel** or **Netlify**.

8. Testing:
   - No unit or integration tests are written. Tools like **Jest** and **React Testing Library** can be used for testing.

9. Accessibility:
   - Accessibility features (e.g., ARIA labels, keyboard navigation) are not fully implemented.

10. Styling Enhancements:
    - The UI can be further polished with animations, transitions, and better typography.
